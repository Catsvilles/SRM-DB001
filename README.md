# how to use

- [build a 128 for Drum Rack](https://www.reddit.com/r/ableton/comments/b5osf8/the_last_drum_rack_youll_ever_have_to_make/);  Assign your drums as follows:
 - C1: kick
 - C#1: clap
 - D1: snare
 - D#1: closed hi hat
 - G#1: open hi hat
 - A1: shaker
 - A#1: percussion 1
 - B1: percussion 2
 - E2: ride
- add SRM-DB001 to your track
- click "regenerate" to generate a pattern

You can then play with the parameters and keep regenerating.  When you have something you like, you can click "Gen Clips" to create clips in session view for each of the song sections.

## Drum selector buttons

To the left of each drum name, there is a checkbox.  Uncheck to mute that particular drum.  Note that if you have the drum unchecked, it will not appear in clips you generate, either.

## percussion shift buttons

To the right of the Perc1 and Perc2 rows in the grid, there are shift buttons you can use to shift the notes for that drum by 1, 2, or 4 16th notes in either direction.

## song section

Select a song section from the dropdown to hear a variant of the beat for that song section.

## locks

Lock specific drum groups from being regenerated.  If you're happy with portions of the beat, but you just want to change out specific drum groups, you can check the appropriate lock buttons.  Note that the drum groups do not correlate 1:1 to the individual drums; some drum groups combine multiple drums (for instance, "tops-primary" might include both the open hi-hat and the closed hi-hat).

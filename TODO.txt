BUG: breakdown 1 not working?

- clip output (all 5 clips)

- support for note velocity

- add controls:
   - regen of individual parts
   - config drums

- extend patterns to 8 bars (not sure how -- use a really long grid?  use two grids that swap in and out?)

- add support for fills at 4 bars and 8 bars
